I do not find setting X.
------
Some settings are not always visible. There are three reasons why settings might be hidden:

* Some require other settings to be a certain value to be displayed because they are not useful without the other setting. E.g. the whole "Asking" section is only displayed when the block mode is set to "ask for permission".
* Other settings are hidden behind the "expert mode" because they need a certain level of understanding of CanvasBlocker to be used correctly.
* Finally you can hide settings. To show these settings you have to enable "display hidden settings".

So if you search for a setting and do not find it you should first enable the "expert mode" and "display hidden settings". If you then still do not find it it's not relevant for your current setup of CanvasBlocker.
